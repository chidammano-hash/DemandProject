Feature 0 Prompt:
I created the feature0.md basically to come up with the right infrastructure for supply chain demand forecasting. to do traditional, and ML based forecasting and lightning fast analysis in the UI and aggregations with item, location and customer attributes and should be able to handle 500 millions and more records. Please refine and make it simple. Iceberg, spark,trino that you suggested earlier are missing. refine and make a simple .md file with the right recommendation. 
Addiitonal prompts: MLFlow etc


Write feature1.md: Build an internal data structure for the supply chain demand forecasting that seemlessly goes well with the Iceberg, MlFLOW, postgres, and other technologies. The purpose is to store the data on item( multiple hierarchy/attributes) , storage locations(  multiple hierarchy/attirbutes), customer( multiple hierarchies/attributes). The sales history including qty sold, qty demanded, qty delievered etc. Pricing info promo information, external weather/events. forecasts generated, forecast archival at multiple lags, maintaing different forecasts from different algorithms, measuring KPIs, dashboarding etc. Also the best of the best forecasting internal data architecture that is robust and can be easily mapped to any customer data via mapping tables. Metadata layer and storage dat layer for easy retrievals. Can you refine, we need to add item,storage location level supersession information since this is critical. once superceded the new item should replace the archives for the old location. Secondly, the data structure should be able to do both monthly and weekly forecasting.
